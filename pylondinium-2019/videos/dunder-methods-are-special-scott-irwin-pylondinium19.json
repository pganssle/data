    "description": "Special methods are those methods on a type which are called implicitly by Python to execute a certain operation (e.g., addition). These methods have distinctive names which start and end with double underscores (aka dunder).\n\nDunder methods are a language feature which allows developers to implement custom types which have the same features and expressiveness as the Python standard types.\n\nIt is impossible to discuss all of the various dunder methods in a single 25-minute talk, so we will focus on a selected subset of dunder methods. We will discuss how and why you would implement them and in which situations Python will implicitly call them.",
