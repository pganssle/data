    "description": "During 2018 Iâ€™ve been a contractor for the Italian Digital Transformation Team working on docs.italia.it (Docs Italia), an Open Source platform to collect and share the Public Administration documentation. We didn't write Docs Italia from scratch though but built it on top of Read The Docs, the leading documentation platform for Python packages. We saved a lot of work by leveraging another open source project. Cool! Still Open Source software does not write itself and we managed to contribute back some value to the upstream project. In this talk I'll share what we did and what we learned.",
